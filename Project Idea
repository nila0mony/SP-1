Project Title: OrderOpus


Unique idea: "OrderOpus" is an app which connects the restaurants withtheconsumers in a selected area within a certain radius. This app only does the job of connection and has no delivery service, the delivery should be done by the individual restaurants. No commission will be taken from the foods sold by the restaurants, rather a monthly service charge will be taken at the beginning of the month.


Merits:
1.Customers & owners arenâ€™t dependent on any 3rd party app. 
2. Won't take any commission from the restaurants owners. 
3. Food quality & quantity remains intact.


Demerits:
1. Don't have our own delivery system, restaurant's are responsible for the delivery.
